# Geochemical-Data-Analysis
Predicting Amorphous Silica Levels in Geothermal Systems
(Group Project for EOSC 410 - UBC)
- Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify key geochemical factors affecting silica solubility.
- Built a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict silica levels from borehole data, achieving high correlation with temperature trends.
- Applied ensemble learning for improved robustness in geothermal system modeling.
- Outcome: Created a scalable framework for geochemical data analysis with implications for geothermal resource optimization.
